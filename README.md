# BeepSign
Beepsign is a smart audio-to-text display device that decodes data encoded as audio tones through a standard 3.5mm jack. It listens to short tone sequences embedded before music playback, extracts the hidden message (like song titles or info), and displays it visually, then seamlessly plays the song.
